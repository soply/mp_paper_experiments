# mp_paper_experiments
This repository contains numerical experiments for the paper 'Support recovery in unmixing problems by means of an altered Lasso-path algorithm for multi-penalty regularization'. In this work, we consider problems of the type 




Specifically, the repository contains different types of experiments:

  - Experiments where we investigate if there exists any parameter combination $\alpha, \beta$ such that we can recover the correct support.
  - Experiments where we investigate if a simple criterion
